MRI &amp; Alzheimers Risk Analysis with Excel &amp; PowerBI


## Executive Summary
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of the OASIS-1 cross-sectional MRI dataset, encompassing **416 subjects aged 18 to 96**, to identify and visualize the key risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease. The analysis reveals that individuals with a college degree or higher have a **35% lower prevalence of dementia** compared to those with only a high school education. Furthermore, neuroimaging data indicates that demented subjects exhibit an average **Normalized Whole Brain Volume (nWBV) that is 15% lower** than their non-demented counterparts within the same age group, highlighting significant brain atrophy as a key biomarker.

The project workflow begins with rigorous data cleaning and feature engineering in **Excel**, establishing foundational insights through PivotTables and statistical charts. The analysis is then elevated in **Power BI**, where an interactive dashboard allows for multi-dimensional exploration of risk factors, leading to the development of a composite risk score for clinical assessment.
